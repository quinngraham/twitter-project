just messing around with twitter's APIs

I was working on this as a small passion project, as I've used twitter for years and wanted to clean up my following. 
However, due to Elon's paywalling of the APIs, I am no longer able to do so. Very unfortunate, as I was having a lot of fun
with this one! I might have found an API key that will allow me access, but it will require some testing.
